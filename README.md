 # Initial beta calculator for PERT
 
 Test it out: https://sandboxexperimentation.github.io/EPI-calc-beta/
 
 Calculate ratios of lipase:fat and protease:protein based on doses of PERT (pancrelipase) that work well
 
 TO DOs:
 - [x] Take input of new meal
 - [x] Add additional input of dose type/size
 - [x] Calculate amount of lipase, protease based on above
 - [x] Calculate number of pills needed, based on above inputs
 - [x] Add basic design elements
 - [ ] Add error checking
 - [ ] Add toggle for supplemental lipase
 - [ ] Add input for supplemental lipase quantity
 - [ ] Recalculate pills needed 
 - [ ] Print/export options?
